# signature-verification
-A deep learning solution that automatically detects fake signatures by analyzing handwriting patterns.

-Cleans and enhances signature images using smart algorithms before processing.

-Trains a neural network to spot tiny differences between real and forged signatures.

-Creates extra training examples by artificially modifying real signatures.

-Built with powerful AI tools including Python's computer vision and deep learning libraries.

-Delivers accurate results quickly, even with large batches of documents.
